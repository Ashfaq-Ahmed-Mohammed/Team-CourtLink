# UF CourtLink 

## THE WHY

UF Rec Center's sporting facilities are often hailed as some of the best in the nation. However, gaining access to them proved to be an issue. For instance, the other day upon securing the equipment, we walked to the courts only to find them all occupied. The help desk had no knowledge of availability, and we weren't able to play. Thus, we decided to book a court in advance next time. But, a quick search on Google revealed that this was not possible. Booking of courts was only possible for large sporting events and even then, there was no streamlined procedure for the same. So, we took it upon ourselves to doctor a solution.

## THE HOW

Our application offers an efficient solution for booking sports facilities, providing users with seamless access to information on court availability and time slots. It simplifies the booking process, allowing users to effortlessly view, select, and confirm their preferred slots. For administrators, the platform ensures easy management of reservations, minimizing scheduling conflicts and maximizing court utilization.

## Key features include:

- **User-Friendly Booking System**: Players can quickly find available time slots for various courts (e.g., tennis, basketball,           badminton) and reserve them with just a few taps.

- **Real-Time Court Availability**: The system displays up-to-date availability, preventing double bookings and ensuring efficient use of the facilities.

- **Seamless Confirmation**: Once a slot is selected, users can instantly confirm their booking and receive reminders ahead of their session.

- **Administrator Control Panel**: Facility managers can monitor and oversee all reservations, adjust schedules, and resolve any potential conflicts easily.

- **Hassle-Free Experience**: Both players and administrators benefit from an intuitive, streamlined process that ensures a smooth, stress-free experience for everyone involved.
